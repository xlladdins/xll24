# Excel add-in library

There is a reason why many companies
still use the ancient Microsoft
Excel C SDK. It provides the
highest possible performance
for integrating C, C++, and Fortran
into Excel. VBA, C# VSTO, 
and JavaScript require data
to be marshalled into their
world and then copied back 
to native Excel.

There is a reason why many companies
don't use the ancient Microsoft
Excel C SDK. It is notoriously
difficult to use. This library
makes it easy to call any
language from Excel.

## Function

Excel is purely functional.
Every function returns a
result that depends only
on the function arguments.

## Macro

A macro can do anything a user
can do. It takes no arguments
and returns only a success code.
